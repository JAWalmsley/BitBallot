Node:
    Recieve votes
    Verify votes
    Add votes to blockchain
    Send new blocks to other nodes
    Accept new blocks from other nodes

    Register:
        Voter sends their QR code(user_id), and their public key (keypair derived from password)
        Node stores the user_id, and public key in a new "register" block

    Vote:
        Voter sends their user_id, signed with the same password as registered with; and their candidate choice
        Node checks if signature matches the public key saved for the user_id
